Welcome to my **Manual Quality Assurance** learning project.  
This repository contains all the materials, notes, exercises, and documentation created during my learning journey to become a Manual QA Tester.

The project is structured day-by-day and covers core QA concepts such as test case design, bug reporting, software testing fundamentals, Agile workflow, and basic usage of Git/GitHub for QA work.

By following this learning plan I aim to:

- Understand the fundamentals of software testing
- Learn how to design professional test cases
- Report bugs using a structured template
- Work with Git & GitHub in a QA environment
- Understand Agile/Scrum workflow
- Practice on real websites and applications
