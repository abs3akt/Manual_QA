Today I created the repository Manual_QA and initialized the project structure.
The goal of this project is to practice and document manual testing concepts, including:

- Testing theory
- Test case creation
- Bug reporting
- Testing techniques
- Tools used in manual QA

I will update the project daily with learning progress, practical examples, and testing exercises.
This marks the start of my journey into Quality Assurance.
